I am a PhD candidate in physics in the [Bruder group](https://quantumtheory-bruder.physik.unibas.ch/en/) within the "Quantum Computing and Quantum Technology" PhD school at the University of Basel. I have participated in the Google Summer of Code 2020 program with [the project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5076877036748800/) "High weak order stochastic differential equation solvers and their utility in neural stochastic differential equations" within the Julia Language organization. The project was supervised by [Chris Rackauckas](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas), [Moritz Schauer](https://github.com/mschauer), and  [Yingbo Ma](https://github.com/YingboMa). Since 2020, I am a member of the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) open source software organization for scientific machine learning.
