I am a postdoc in the [Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu/) located in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My research is focused on [Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)](https://sciml.ai/). I completed my PhD in physics in the [Bruder group](https://quantumtheory-bruder.physik.unibas.ch/en/) within the "Quantum Computing and Quantum Technology" PhD school at the University of Basel. During my PhD, I participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 and 2021 programs with the projects "[High weak order stochastic differential equation solvers and their utility in neural stochastic differential equations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5076877036748800/)" within the Julia Language organization and "[Neural Hybrid Differential Equations and Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5357798591823872)"  within the NumFocus organization, supervised by [Chris Rackauckas](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas), [Moritz Schauer](https://github.com/mschauer), [Mohamed Tarek](https://github.com/mohamed82008), and [Yingbo Ma](https://github.com/YingboMa). Since 2020, I am a member of the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) open source software organization for scientific machine learning.
