## Project summary

In this project, we have implemented state-of-the-art sensitivity tools for chaotic dynamical systems, continuous adjoint sensitivity methods for hybrid differential equations, as well as an high level API for automatic differentiation.

Possible fields of application for these tools range from model discovery with explicit dosing times in pharmacology, over accurate gradient estimates for chaotic fluid dynamics, to the control of open quantum systems. A more detailed summary is available [on the GSoC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5357798591823872).


## Blog posts

The following blog posts describe the work in more detail throughout the GSoC period:

1) [Neural Hybrid Differential Equations](https://frankschae.github.io/post/hybridde/)
2) [Shadowing Methods for Forward and Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis of Chaotic Systems](https://frankschae.github.io/post/shadowing/)
3) [Sensitivity Analysis of Hybrid Differential Equations](https://frankschae.github.io/post/bouncing_ball/)
4) [AbstractDifferentiation.jl for AD-backend agnostic code](https://frankschae.github.io/post/abstract_differentiation/)

## Docs

Documentation with respect to the adjoint sensitivity tools will be available [on the local sensitivity analysis](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/analysis/sensitivity/) and [on the control of automatic differentiation choices](http://scimlbase.sciml.ai/dev/fundamentals/Differentiation/) pages.

## Future work

Besides the implementation of more shadowing methods, such as

* [NILSAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08674),
* [FD-NILSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06633), or
* [Fast linear response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00595),

we are planning to

* benchmark the new adjoints,
* refine the AbstractDifferentiation.jl package and use it within DiffEqSensitivity.jl,
* add more docs, and examples.
